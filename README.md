## About Fred Grott

Hi there, this is Fred Grott. I recently re-booted my life by getting control of my ADHD through such things as creating a note taking system using VSCode and ZettleKatsen note taking systems. 

My goal here is to bootstrap myself into mastering Flutter app development while at the same time teach you the expert fltter best practices that are not in the flutter docs.

Lets make Flutter Apps Awesome!
